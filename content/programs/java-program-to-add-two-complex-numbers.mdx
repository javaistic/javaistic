description: In this tutorial, we will write a Java program to add two complex numbers.

Complex numbers have two parts – real part and imaginary part. When adding complex numbers we add real parts together and imaginary parts together as shown in the following diagram.
[Addition of two complex numbers]

## Adding two complex numbers in Java

n this program we have a class `ComplexNumber`. In this class we have two instance variables `real` and `img` to hold the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers.

We have declared a method sum() to [add the two numbers](./add-two-integers) by adding their real and imaginary parts together.

The constructor of this class is used for initializing the complex numbers. For e.g. when we create an instance of this class like this `ComplexNumber temp = new ComplexNumber(0, 0);`, it actually creates a complex number `0 + 0i`.

### Code:

```java
public class ComplexNumber{
   //for real and imaginary parts of complex numbers
   double real, img;

   //constructor to initialize the complex number
   ComplexNumber(double r, double i){
	this.real = r;
	this.img = i;
   }

   public static ComplexNumber sum(ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
   {
	//creating a temporary complex number to hold the sum of two numbers
        ComplexNumber temp = new ComplexNumber(0, 0);

        temp.real = c1.real + c2.real;
        temp.img = c1.img + c2.img;

        //returning the output complex number
        return temp;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
	ComplexNumber c1 = new ComplexNumber(5.5, 4);
	ComplexNumber c2 = new ComplexNumber(1.2, 3.5);
        ComplexNumber temp = sum(c1, c2);
        System.out.printf("Sum is: "+ temp.real+" + "+ temp.img +"i");
    }
}
```

### Output:

```plaintext
Sum is: 6.7 + 7.5i
```
