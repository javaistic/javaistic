## Java Data Types

As the name suggests, data types specify the type of data that can be stored inside [variables in Java](/docs/variables-and-literals).

Java is a statically-typed language. This means that all variables must be declared before they can be used.

```java
int speed;
```

Here, `speed` is a variable, and the data type of the variable is `int`.

The `int` data type determines that the `speed` variable can only contain integers.

There are 8 data types predefined in Java programming language, known as primitive data types.

**Note :** In addition to primitive data types, there are also referenced
types (object type).

## 8 Primitive Data Types

### 1. boolean type

- The `boolean` data type has two possible values, either true or false.
- They are usually used for **true/false** conditions.
- **Default value : `false`**.

#### Example 1: Java `boolean` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean flag = true;
    System.out.println(flag); // prints true
  }
}
```

### 2. byte type

- The `byte` data type can have values from **-128** to **127** (8-bit signed two's complement integer).
- If it's certain that the value of a variable will be within -128 to 127, then it is used instead of int to save memory.
- **Default value : 0**

#### Example 2: Java `byte` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    byte range;
    range = 124;
    System.out.println(range);    // prints 124
  }
}
```

### 3. short type

- The `short` data type in Java can have values from **-32768** to **32767** (16-bit signed two's complement integer).
- If it's certain that the value of a variable will be within -32768 and 32767, then it is used instead of other integer data types (`int`, `long`).
- **Default value : 0**

#### Example 3: Java `short` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    short temperature;
    temperature = -200;
    System.out.println(temperature); // prints -200
  }
}
```

### 4. int type

- The int data type can have values from **-2<sup>31</sup>** to **2<sup>31</sup> -1** (32-bit signed two's complement integer).
- If you are using Java 8 or later, you can use an unsigned 32-bit integer. This will have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2<sup>32-1</sup>. To learn more, visit [How to use the unsigned integer in java 8?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25556017/how-to-use-the-unsigned-integer-in-java-8)
- **Default value : 0**

#### Example 4: Java `int` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int range = -4250000;
    System.out.println(range); // print -4250000
  }
}
```

### 5. long type

- The `long` data type can have values from **-2<sup>63</sup>** to **2<sup>63</sup> -1** (64-bit signed two's complement integer).
- If you are using Java 8 or later, you can use an unsigned 64-bit integer with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2<sup>64</sup> -1.
- **Default value : 0**

#### Example 5: Java `long` data type

```java
class LongExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long range = -42332200000L;
    System.out.println(range); // prints -42332200000
  }
}
```

Notice, the use of `L` at the end of `-42332200000`. This represents that it's an integral literal of the `long` type. You will learn about integral literals later in this article.

### 6. double type

- The `double` data type is a double-precision 64-bit floating-point.
- It should never be used for precise values such as currency.
- **Default value : 0.0 (0.0d)**

#### Example 6: Java `double` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double number = -42.3;
    System.out.println(number); // prints -42.3
  }
}
```

### 7. float type

- The `float` data type is a single-precision 32-bit floating-point.Learn more about [single-precision and double-precision floating-point](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/801117/whats-the-difference-between-a-single-precision-and-double-precision-floating-p) if you are interested.
- It should never be used for precise values such as currency.
- **Default value : 0.0 (0.0f)**

#### Example 7: Java `float` data type

```java highlight=3
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float number = -42.3f;
    System.out.println(number); // prints -42.3
  }
}
```

Notice that, we have used `-42.3f` instead of `-42.3` in the above program. It's because `-42.3` is a `double` literal.
To tell the compiler to treat `-42.3` as `float` rather than `double`, you need to use `f` or `F`.

### 8. char type

- It's a 16-bit Unicode character.
- The minimum value of the `char` data type is `'\u0000'` (0) and the maximum value of the is `'\uffff'`.
- **Default value : '\u0000'**

#### Example 8: Java `char` data type

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char letter = '\u0051';
    System.out.println(letter); // prints Q
  }
}
```

Here, the Unicode value of Q is `\u0051`. Hence, we get Q as the output.

Here is another example:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char letter1 = '9';
    System.out.println(letter1); // prints 9
    char letter2 = 65;
    System.out.println(letter2); // prints A
  }
}
```

Here, we have assigned 9 as a character (specified by single quotes) to the letter1 variable. However, the letter2 variable is assigned 65 as an integer number (no single quotes).

Hence, A is printed to the output. It is because Java treats characters as integral types and the ASCII value of A is 65. To learn more about ASCII, visit What is ASCII Code?.

## String type

Java also provides support for character strings via java.lang.String class. Strings in Java are not primitive types. Instead, they are objects. For example,

```java
String myString = "Java Programming";
```

Here, myString is an object of the String class. To learn more, visit [Java Strings](/docs/string).
