In this tutorial, you will learn about [JDK](#what-is-jdk), [JRE](#what-is-jre), and [JVM](#what-is-jvm). You will also learn the key differences between them.

## What is JVM?

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.

When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).

Java is a **platform-independent language**. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since JVM ​executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.

## What is JRE?

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** is a software package that provides Java class libraries, **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, and other components that are required to run Java applications.

JRE is the superset of JVM.

**Java Runtime Environment**

If you need to run Java programs, but not develop them, JRE is what you need. You can download JRE from [Java SE Runtime Environment 8 Downloads page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).

## What is JDK?

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.

In addition to JRE, JDK also contains a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc).

  **Java Development Kit**

If you want to develop Java applications, [download JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html).
