To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:
- [Java Operator](/docs/operator)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)

## Check Leap year

A java program that checks wheather the given year is leap year or not is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class checkLeapYear{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int year;
    boolean isLeapYear;
    System.out.print("Enter the year to check: ");
    // instance of scanner class
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    // taking user input in year variable
    year = input.nextInt();
    // checking weather the year is leap or not
    isLeapYear = year % 4 == 0;
		
    if(isLeapYear){
        System.out.println(year + " is leap year");
    }else{
        System.out.println(year + " isn't leap year");
    }
    input.close();
  }
}
```

#### Output 1

```text
Enter the year to check: 2003
2003 isn't leap year
```
#### Output 2
```text
Enter the year to check: 2004
2004 is leap year
```

To check weather a `year` is `leap` or not we only need to check weather it's `divisible by 4` or not if it doesn't leave reminder then leap year else not a leap year

Don't know how to take input from the user ? Look at [this examples](/docs/basic-input-output#java-input)

Here two input numbers are taken from user one after another with space in between them which distinguish between two different inputs, this useful behavior is because of the default settings of Scanner called as Delimiter, [learn more here](https://www.javatpoint.com/post/java-scanner-delimiter-method).
