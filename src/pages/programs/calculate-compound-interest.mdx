title: Java program To Calculate Compound Interest
shotTitle: Calculate Compound Interest
description: This code takes the principal amount, annual interest rate (as a percentage), number of years, and compounding frequency (how many times per year the interest is compounded) as input from the user.

import { List, ListItemGood } from '@/components/List'

The integer is stored in a variable using `System.in`, and is displayed on the screen using `System.out`.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

- [Java Operators](/docs/operators)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)

## To calculate the Compound Interest

A java program to calculate Compound Interest


## Java Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CompoundInterestCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input principal amount
        System.out.print("Enter the principal amount: ");
        double principal = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Input annual interest rate (as a percentage)
        System.out.print("Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): ");
        double annualRate = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Input number of years
        System.out.print("Enter the number of years: ");
        int years = scanner.nextInt();

        // Input number of times interest is compounded per year
        System.out.print("Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: ");
        int compoundingFrequency = scanner.nextInt();

        // Convert annual rate to decimal and calculate compound interest
        double rate = annualRate / 100;
        double amount = principal * Math.pow(1 + (rate / compoundingFrequency), compoundingFrequency * years);

        // Calculate compound interest
        double compoundInterest = amount - principal;

        // Display the result
        System.out.println("The compound interest after " + years + " years is: " + compoundInterest);

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

#### Output 1

```plaintext
Enter the principal amount: 5000
Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): 5
Enter the number of years: 3
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 4
The compound interest after 3 years is: 797.1955807499652
```

#### Output 2

```plaintext
Enter the principal amount: 10000
Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage): 3.5
Enter the number of years: 5
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 12
The compound interest after 5 years is: 1938.8365362833173
```
