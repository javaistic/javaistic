To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

- [Java Operators](/docs/operators)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)

## Calculate Simple Interest

A java program that calculate the simple interest by getting user input for priniple amount, Rate of interest, Time Period.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class simpleInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int principleAmount,time;
        float interestRatePerAnnum;
        // instance of Scanner class
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        // taking user input
        System.out.print("Enter the principle amount : ");
        principleAmount = input.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the rate of interest(per annum): ");
        interestRatePerAnnum = input.nextFloat();
        System.out.print("Enter the time period(y): ");
        time = input.nextInt();

        float simpleInterest = (principleAmount * interestRatePerAnnum * time)/100;

        System.out.println("Simple Interest: " + simpleInterest);

        float totalAmountToReceive = principleAmount + simpleInterest;
        System.out.println("Total amount person receive after " + time + " year" + ": " + totalAmountToReceive);
    }
}
```

#### Output

```text
Enter the principle amount : 1500
Enter the rate of interest(per annum): 8
Enter the time period(y): 5
Simple Interest: 600.0
Total amount person receive after 5 year: 2100.
```

To Calculate Simple interest ,
```SimpleInterest = (P*R*T)/100```


here, P = principleAmount
      R = Rate of interest (%)
      T = Time Period (per annum),

We need to take user input for following (P,R,T) and then apply the formulae using ```*,/``` operator. And then, print the output to user's terminal using ```println()``` funciton.

<TipInfo>

Don't know how to take input from the user ? Look at [this examples](/docs/basic-input-output#java-input)

Here two input numbers are taken from user one after another with space in between them which distinguish between two different inputs, this useful behavior is because of the default settings of Scanner called as Delimiter, [learn more here](https://www.javatpoint.com/post/java-scanner-delimiter-method).
